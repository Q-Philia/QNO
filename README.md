# QNO
Quantum Computing Video Game
QNO was developed by Q-philia, a quantum computing video game studio comprised solely of Daniel Winton (me). QNO was originally developed as a submission to the Quantum AI Foundation's Quantum Games Hackathon competition. The goal of the game is to provide both a super fun gameplay experience, and an introduction to quantum states, gates, superposition, and measurement. The game will continue to be updated to improve the gameplay experience, and to introduce more topics in quantum computing. I hope you have as much fun playing the game as I had making it!
