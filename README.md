# QNO

You can play QNO at the following colab link. Afer clicking on the link go to File - Save a Copy in Drive. This will open up a copy of the colab notebook. Now, you can run the code by clicking the arrows to the left of the code. Run block 1 and then run block 2. After running block 1 for the first time you will not need to run it again. So, any time you want to play the game you can just run the second block.

QNO was developed by Q-philia, a quantum computing video game studio comprised solely of Daniel Winton (me). QNO was originally developed as a submission to the Quantum AI Foundation's Quantum Games Hackathon competition. The goal of the game is to provide both a super fun gameplay experience, and an introduction to quantum states, gates, superposition, and measurement. The game will continue to be updated to improve the gameplay experience, and to introduce more topics in quantum computing. I recommend that you read the game's rules and relevant quantum computing information before playing for the first time. You can access this information at the start and end of each turn of the game. I hope you have as much fun playing the game as I had making it!
