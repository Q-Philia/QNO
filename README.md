# QNO

You can play QNO at the following colab link. You just need to click the sideways triangle to the left of the code. After running the code for the first time you should put a # in front of the 3rd line of code "!pip install..." this way you don't need to install the Qiskit package each time you run the code.

QNO was developed by Q-philia, a quantum computing video game studio comprised solely of Daniel Winton (me). QNO was originally developed as a submission to the Quantum AI Foundation's Quantum Games Hackathon competition. The goal of the game is to provide both a super fun gameplay experience, and an introduction to quantum states, gates, superposition, and measurement. The game will continue to be updated to improve the gameplay experience, and to introduce more topics in quantum computing. I recommend that you read the game's rules and relevant quantum computing information before playing for the first time. You can access this information at the start and end of each turn of the game. I hope you have as much fun playing the game as I had making it!
